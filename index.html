              let me introduce myself. <br>
              <br>
              My name is <span class="highlight">Jan Ortelius</span>, and as of a few
              weeks ago I’ve been looking for a job as a
              printer or typesetter… or actually I really
              like the <span class="highlight">Officina Plantiniana</span>. <br>
              <br>
              It really is everything I’m looking for in
              terms of a job. I have a great preference
              for printing however, I do not mind as long
              as I can stay in the printing business like
              my late father. And let’s face it, there won’t
              be a better place in the world for a flemish
              lad to work than the Officina Plantiniana
              here in Antwerp.

                Officina Plantiniana to a regular
                printing shop of my time: <br>
                Let’s start with the obvious, the scale
                of it all… . At the Officina Plantiniana,
                Plantin has like <span class="highlight">22</span> presses - yeah 22!
                Can you imagine just how big this
                place is.

                Most printing shops can barely keep
                one or two presses running,
                but Plantin, he got this monumental
                operation where every machine
                hums with purpose. It’s like walking
                into a symphony of levers and ink.
                Everyone has their own job they
                need to fulfil with sometimes
                interchanging roles. <br>
                <br>
                Currently there are <span class="highlight">55</span> people
                working, I hope that I can be the
                56th one. So he has <span class="highlight">

                  20 compositors, 3 proof-readers

              is that he prints the largest Polyglot Bible. <br>

              The bible actually goes by a few names:
              ‘The Plantin Polyglot’, ‘The Antwerp Polyglot’, ‘The Biblia Regia’ or ‘King’s Bible’ and it was written in 5
              languages:
              Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, and Syrian (technically Ancient Syrian for you). <br>
              <br>
              The project was so big that he needed 4 years to finish it; well that’s also because he made 1200 paper

              of it!

          First the forme, locked up in the chase, is inked on the press with the ink balls or dabbers. The slightly
          moistened
          paper is then clamped between the frisket and the tympan. With a sudden movement it is brought into contact with
          the
          type. Finally, the printer (me in the future) removes the printed paper, which will then be hung up to dry.

          In the case of a normal book 1250 sheets of paper can be printed on both sides in a day on a single press, which
          means a
          printer has to perform 2500 impressions, which is like a whole lot... so an assistant usually helps the printer
          for
          this. So I’ll most likely start as an assistant first but not to worry, I have a plan to get me to the top spot

              Now that you know why I like the working place, how about I tell you all about my future boss huh?
              The man is a <span class="highlight">legend</span>. <br>
              <br>
              When he first started he was just another printer trying to make a name for himself. But over the years, he’
              grown his influence quite a lot. You might wonder how he did that, well I could write a whole book about all
              his
              achievements but let me do my best to summarise the big points to you before you run away. He has a great
              <span class="highlight">knack for spotting
                opportunities</span>. He secured <span class="highlight">exclusive contracts</span> with the Catholic
              Church to print religious text (like the
              Biblia Regia I
              mentioned before) and like you can imagine, that’s a gold mine during this great Catholic era. <br>
              <br>
              But here’s the interesting thing - Plantin’s reputation has <span class="highlight">not always been that
                good</span> sometimes.

                <p>
                  He actually got in trouble a couple of times, the first time something happened was when he was
                  suspected
                  of
                  heresy.
                  They found a Calvinist pamphlet in his print shop, obviously the Catholics did not appreciate this but
                  luckily
                  he was
                  away on a business trip at the time. <br>

                <div class="heresy__small">
                  Then followed a whole ordeal in him getting back all his presses and stuff but like I said to much goes

                  me to

                  Then the second time he got in trouble was when Plantin’s partners who actually were Calvinists, fled to
                  the
                  Netherlands
                  this could have been seen as treason and they could’ve had his head.

                  Then there was the time where he started operations in Leiden. <br>
                  <br>
                  He decided to go there in case the city would
                  get captured by the Spanish governor at the time, but then when he tried to come back to Antwerp some
                  people
                  were
                  against it. This is because after all he came from a place with lots of Calvinists so people thought he
                  was
                  Calvinist - but that
                  was not true. <br>
                  <br>
                  He had to get a letter from the king and then he showed it off to the people to let them know “Hey look,
                  the
                  king approves of me coming back to Antwerp”.
                  He of course had the connection after being the Arch-printer to the king of Spain.

                  Then another time he got in trouble was when the Spanish Fury was unleashed in Antwerp, they even
                  threatened
                  to burn
                  down the Officina Plantiniana.

          <p>
            So that sums up the periods that would be bad to be an employee, but other than that I think he did fine. I
            don’t mind
            printing whatever comes my way, as long as Plantin stays true to God, I will work for him. So far, God does
            not
            seem
            angry, so why should I doubt his faith?

              Okay, now here’s a little secret I found out: if you really want to secure your future at the Officina
              Plantiniana, you
              might want to pull a Jan Moretus. If you haven’t heard of him,
              he’s the guy who married Plantin’s daughter (Martina Plantin) and, in doing so, secured his job and is now
              set
              to
              inherit the entire business someday. <br>
              <br>
              Now I’m not saying you should get married just for the job - that would be too much. But clearly connections
              matter
              Moretus didn’t just marry into the family; he proved himself worthy as a worker first. He learned the trade,
              worked his
              way up, earned Plantin’s trust, then just sealed the deal with a ring.
              He was just an opportunist and devoted to the company, trust me, Plantin would not let just anyone become
              the
              next heir. <br>
              <br>
              Although it would be nice to marry my way into this grand entreprise, I want to earn my spot next to them.
