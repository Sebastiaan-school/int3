          let me introduce myself. <br>
          <br>
          My name is Jan Ortelius, and as of a few
          weeks ago I’ve been looking for a job as a
          printer or typesetter… or actually I really
          like the Officina Plantiniana. <br>
          <br>
          It really is everything I’m looking for in
          terms of a job. I have a great preference
          for printing however, I do not mind as long
          as I can stay in the printing business like
          my late father. And let’s face it, there won’t
          be a better place in the world for a flemish
          lad to work than the Officina Plantiniana
          here in Antwerp.

            The port is one of the busiest in Europe
            during our time, connected to the River

        moving heavy printing presses and materials;

        Antwerp is a booming trade hub, full of
        merchants, scholars, and craftsmen who could
        appreciate the value of books.
        Think about it - a city where you could sell your

          But enough now about the city, do you know <br>
          why I really want to work for Plantin… <br>
          <br>
          I’ll tell you - it’s all about the great <br>
          ‘Officina Plantiniana’. <br>
          Let me make my obsession clear to you in a not <br>
          so structured manner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="officina__right">
        <p>
          Let’s compare the workforce of the <br>
          Officina Plantiniana to a regular <br>
          printing shop of my time: <br>
          Let’s start with the obvious, the scale <br>
          of it all… . At the Officina Plantiniana, <br>
          Plantin has like 22 presses - yeah 22! <br>
          Can you imagine just how big this <br>
          place is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scale">
        <p>
          Most printing shops can barely keep <br>
          one or two presses running, <br>
          but Plantin, he got this monumental <br>
          operation where every machine <br>
          hums with purpose. It’s like walking <br>
          into a symphony of levers and ink. <br>
          Everyone has their own job they <br>
          need to fulfil with sometimes <br>
          interchanging roles. <br>
          <br>
          Currently there are 55 people <br>
          working, I hope that I can be the <br>
          56th one. So he has 31 printers, <br>
          20 compositors, 3 proof-readers and <br>
          one unskilled labourer. It truly is the <br>
          largest of the time.

      <div class="polyglot__section">
        <p>
          Now I hear you thinking, what would he ever need all that workforce for? Well, one of the many achievements of
          Plantin
          is that he prints the largest Polyglot Bible. <br>
          <br>
          He actually did this to get him out of some trouble and prove his loyalty to the Catholic king Philip II of
          Spain - but
          more about that later.
        </p>
        <img class="polyglot__img" src="./src/assets/img/bible.png" alt="polyglot bible">
        <p>
          The bible actually goes by a few names:
          ‘The Plantin Polyglot’, ‘The Antwerp Polyglot’, ‘The Biblia Regia’ or ‘King’s Bible’ and it was written in 5
          languages:
          Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, and Syrian (technically Ancient Syrian for you). <br>
          <br>
          The project was so big that he needed 4 years to finish it; well that’s also because he made 1200 paper copies
          of it!

      I’ll let you in on how it works, and then after I want you to link some of the words I used to their corresponding
      stamps: <br>
      <br>
      First the forme, locked up in the chase, is inked on the press with the ink balls or dabbers. The slightly
      moistened
      paper is then clamped between the frisket and the tympan. With a sudden movement it is brought into contact with
      the
      type. Finally, the printer (me in the future) removes the printed paper, which will then be hung up to dry.

      In the case of a normal book 1250 sheets of paper can be printed on both sides in a day on a single press, which
      means a
      printer has to perform 2500 impressions, which is like a whole lot... so an assistant usually helps the printer
      for
      this. So I’ll most likely start as an assistant first but not to worry, I have a plan to get me to the top spot in
      no
      time...

          The man is a legend. <br>
          <br>
          When he first started he was just another printer trying to make a name for himself. But over the years, he’
          grown his
          influence quite a lot. You might wonder how he did that, well I could write a whole book about all his
          achievements but
          let me do my best to summarise the big points to you before you run away. He has a great knack for spotting
          opportunities. He secured exclusive contracts with the Catholic Church to print religious text (like the
          Biblia Regia I
          mentioned before) and like you can imagine, that’s a gold mine during this great Catholic era. <br>
          <br>
          But here’s the interesting thing - Plantin’s reputation has not always been that good sometimes.

      <div>
        <p>
          He actually got in trouble a couple of times, the first time something happened was when he was suspected of
          heresy.
          They found a Calvinist pamphlet in his print shop, obviously the Catholics did not appreciate this but luckily
          he was
          away on a business trip at the time. <br>
          <br>
        <div class="heresy__small">
          Then followed a whole ordeal in him getting back all his presses and stuff but like I said to much goes on for
          me to
          tell that part of his story you’ll have to check that out yourself when you go to his place…

      <h3 class="trouble__sub">FLEEING</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Then the second time he got in trouble was when Plantin’s partners who actually were Calvinists, fled to the
          Netherlands
          this could have been seen as treason and they could’ve had his head.

      <h3 class="trouble__sub">A LETTER</h3>

        <p>
          Then there was the time where he started operations in Leiden. <br>
          <br>
          He decided to go there in case the city would
          get captured by the Spanish governor at the time, but then when he tried to come back to Antwerp some people
          were
          against it. This is because after all he came from a place with lots of Calvinists so people thought he was
          Calvinist - but that
          was not true. <br>
          <br>
          He had to get a letter from the king and then he showed it off to the people to let them know “Hey look, the
          king approves of me coming back to Antwerp”.
          He of course had the connection after being the Arch-printer to the king of Spain.

      <h3 class="trouble__sub">'BURN'</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Then another time he got in trouble was when the Spanish Fury was unleashed in Antwerp, they even threatened
          to burn
          down the Officina Plantiniana.
        </p>

        So that sums up the periods that would be bad to be an employee, but other than that I think he did fine. I
        don’t mind
        printing whatever comes my way, as long as Plantin stays true to God, I will work for him. So far, God does not
        seem
        angry, so why should I doubt his faith?

          Okay, now here’s a little secret I found out: if you really want to secure your future at the Officina
          Plantiniana, you
          might want to pull a Jan Moretus. If you haven’t heard of him,
          he’s the guy who married Plantin’s daughter (Martina Plantin) and, in doing so, secured his job and is now set
          to
          inherit the entire business someday. <br>
          <br>
          Now I’m not saying you should get married just for the job - that would be too much. But clearly connections
          matter
          Moretus didn’t just marry into the family; he proved himself worthy as a worker first. He learned the trade,
          worked his
          way up, earned Plantin’s trust, then just sealed the deal with a ring.
          He was just an opportunist and devoted to the company, trust me, Plantin would not let just anyone become the
          next heir. <br>
          <br>
          Although it would be nice to marry my way into this grand entreprise, I want to earn my spot next to them.
