        Oh hey there, you must not be from here… <br>
        let me introduce myself. <br>
        <br>
        My name is Jan Ortelius, and as of a few <br>
        weeks ago I’ve been looking for a job as a <br>
        printer or typesetter… or actually I really <br>
        like the Officina Plantiniana. <br>
        <br>
        It really is everything I’m looking for in <br>
        terms of a job. I have a great preference <br>
        for printing however, I do not mind as long <br>
        as I can stay in the printing business like <br>
        my late father. And let’s face it, there won’t <br>
        be a better place in the world for a flemish <br>
        lad to work than the Officina Plantiniana <br>
        here in Antwerp.

          Antwerp truly is a marvel in terms of <br>

          The port is one of the busiest in Europe <br>

          stretched as far as I can see and beyond.

        But the port wasn’t just about convenience for <br>
        moving heavy printing presses and materials; <br>
        it also means easy access to markets. <br>
        <br>
        Antwerp is a booming trade hub, full of <br>
        merchants, scholars, and craftsmen who could <br>
        appreciate the value of books. <br>
        Think about it - a city where you could sell your <br>
        print locally and ship them out internationally, all <br>
        in one go? That’s a business dream!

        with opportunity, it should be called <br>
        the Golden Age of Antwerp. And <br>
        Plantin in this time, I’ve been told, <br>
        is like the Jeff Bezos of our time - <br>

          But enough now about the city, do you know <br>
          why I really want to work for Plantin… <br>
          <br>
          I’ll tell you - it’s all about the great <br>
          ‘Officina Plantiniana’. <br>
          Let me make my obsession clear to you in a not <br>
          so structured manner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="officina__right">
        <p>
          Let’s compare the workforce of the <br>
          Officina Plantiniana to a regular <br>
          printing shop of my time: <br>
          Let’s start with the obvious, the scale <br>
          of it all… . At the Officina Plantiniana, <br>
          Plantin has like 22 presses - yeah 22! <br>
          Can you imagine just how big this <br>
          place is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scale">
        <p>
          Most printing shops can barely keep <br>
          one or two presses running, <br>
          but Plantin, he got this monumental <br>
          operation where every machine <br>
          hums with purpose. It’s like walking <br>
          into a symphony of levers and ink. <br>
          Everyone has their own job they <br>
          need to fulfil with sometimes <br>
          interchanging roles. <br>
          <br>
          Currently there are 55 people <br>
          working, I hope that I can be the <br>
          56th one. So he has 31 printers, <br>
          20 compositors, 3 proof-readers and <br>
          one unskilled labourer. It truly is the <br>
          largest of the time.

      <h3 class="polyglot__title">Polyglot Bible</h3>
      <div class="polyglot__section">
        <p>
          Now I hear you thinking, what would he ever need all that workforce for? Well, one of the many achievements of
          Plantin
          is that he prints the largest Polyglot Bible. <br>
          <br>
          He actually did this to get him out of some trouble and prove his loyalty to the Catholic king Philip II of
          Spain - but
          more about that later.
        </p>
        <img class="polyglot__img" src="./src/assets/img/bible.png" alt="polyglot bible">
        <p>
          The bible actually goes by a few names:
          ‘The Plantin Polyglot’, ‘The Antwerp Polyglot’, ‘The Biblia Regia’ or ‘King’s Bible’ and it was written in 5
          languages:
          Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldean, and Syrian (technically Ancient Syrian for you). <br>
          <br>
          The project was so big that he needed 4 years to finish it; well that’s also because he made 1200 paper copies
          of it!

      That insane feat aside, let me marvel again at his beatiful machinery. <br>
      <br>
      One of the great printing presses that Plantin has, I’ve come here to study it a couple of times - well I need to
      if I
      want to be a printer here you know.

      I’ll let you in on how it works, and then after I want you to link some of the words I used to their corresponding
      stamps: <br>
      <br>
      First the forme, locked up in the chase, is inked on the press with the ink balls or dabbers. The slightly
      moistened
      paper is then clamped between the frisket and the tympan. With a sudden movement it is brought into contact with
      the
      type. Finally, the printer (me in the future) removes the printed paper, which will then be hung up to dry.
    </p>
    <article class="drag">
      <p class="drag__sub">
        Now that you know how it works, try to match the words with the correct stamp

    <p>
      In the case of a normal book 1250 sheets of paper can be printed on both sides in a day on a single press, which
      means a
      printer has to perform 2500 impressions, which is like a whole lot... so an assistant usually helps the printer
      for
      this. So I’ll most likely start as an assistant first but not to worry, I have a plan to get me to the top spot in
      no
      time...
