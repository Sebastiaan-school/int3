        Oh hey there, you must not be from here… <br>
        let me introduce myself. <br>
        <br>
        My name is Jan Ortelius, and as of a few <br>
        weeks ago I’ve been looking for a job as a <br>
        printer or typesetter… or actually I really <br>
        like the Officina Plantiniana. <br>
        <br>
        It really is everything I’m looking for in <br>
        terms of a job. I have a great preference <br>
        for printing however, I do not mind as long <br>
        as I can stay in the printing business like <br>
        my late father. And let’s face it, there won’t <br>
        be a better place in the world for a flemish <br>
        lad to work than the Officina Plantiniana <br>
        here in Antwerp.

          Antwerp truly is a marvel in terms of <br>
          location in the 16th century. See, Plantin <br>
          did not just pick this location at random.

          You might be wondering now what’s so <br>
          great about this Flemish city that I need 2 <br>
          sentences to describe its beauty. Well, <br>
          what else but the Great Port of Antwerp <br>
          as I like to call it.

          The port is one of the busiest in Europe <br>
          during our time, connected to the River <br>
          Scheldt and opening up trade routes that <br>
          stretched as far as I can see and beyond.

        But the port wasn’t just about convenience for <br>
        moving heavy printing presses and materials; <br>
        it also means easy access to markets. <br>
        <br>
        Antwerp is a booming trade hub, full of <br>
        merchants, scholars, and craftsmen who could <br>
        appreciate the value of books. <br>
        Think about it - a city where you could sell your <br>
        print locally and ship them out internationally, all <br>
        in one go? That’s a business dream!

        The city being so bustling and alive <br>
        with opportunity, it should be called <br>
        the Golden Age of Antwerp. And <br>
        Plantin in this time, I’ve been told, <br>
        is like the Jeff Bezos of our time - <br>
        whoever that guy is …

          But enough now about the city, do you know <br>
          why I really want to work for Plantin… <br>
          <br>
          I’ll tell you - it’s all about the great <br>
          ‘Officina Plantiniana’. <br>
          Let me make my obsession clear to you in a not <br>
          so structured manner.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="officina__right">
        <p>
          Let’s compare the workforce of the <br>
          Officina Plantiniana to a regular <br>
          printing shop of my time: <br>
          Let’s start with the obvious, the scale <br>
          of it all… . At the Officina Plantiniana, <br>
          Plantin has like 22 presses - yeah 22! <br>
          Can you imagine just how big this <br>
          place is.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="scale">
        <p>
          Most printing shops can barely keep <br>
          one or two presses running, <br>
          but Plantin, he got this monumental <br>
          operation where every machine <br>
          hums with purpose. It’s like walking <br>
          into a symphony of levers and ink. <br>
          Everyone has their own job they <br>
          need to fulfil with sometimes <br>
          interchanging roles. <br>
          <br>
          Currently there are 55 people <br>
          working, I hope that I can be the <br>
          56th one. So he has 31 printers, <br>
          20 compositors, 3 proof-readers and <br>
          one unskilled labourer. It truly is the <br>
          largest of the time.
